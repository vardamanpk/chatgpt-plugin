When you send an invoice to a customer, the invoice moves from draft to payable state. PayPal then emails the customer a link to the invoice on the PayPal website. Customers with a PayPal account can log in and pay the invoice with PayPal. Alternatively, customers can pay as a guest with a debit card or credit card. For more information, see the [Invoicing Overview](/docs/invoicing/) and the [Invoicing Integration Guide](/docs/invoicing/basic-integration/).",
